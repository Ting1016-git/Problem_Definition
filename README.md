## Input:

### What information does the program need to start?
The program needs to have the length of the music
Style of music
What type of instrument

### Shall the program request input from users? Make a case for your answer rather than simply give yes or no.
Yes, because without user input, the music output cannot be modified

## Output:
### What does the program produce?
The program will produce instrument notes, later we can add lyrics to the music. Can also add the artist of the song.

### What the generated music might look like, e.g., figures, excel spreadsheet, plain text?
The music will be plain text, showing the notes for the instruments and lyrics for the artist.

## Representation:
### How should the program represent notes? Some examples might include letters (C, D, E), numbers (music signal frequencies), strings (C4 quarter note).
A, B, C, D, E ,F, G 

### How to capture/represent time duration of music notes?
By assigning a note length to each music note when generating the note.

## Logic:
### How could the program decide what note comes next?
The program will randomly determine the next note

### How does the program know when to terminate music generation?
The program will end when the music reaches the user inputted length.

## Extensions:
### What are blockers for generating longer piece of music?
With a longer piece of music, it usually requires a chorus, but it is difficult when the notes are random.
